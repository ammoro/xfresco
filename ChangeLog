11/04/2008: Include ISC<0 in "overlaps" section. ISC<0 for a bound state means that 
            the depth of the corresponding binding potential will be permanently 
            scaled for the remaining overlaps. 

26/10/2007: When "Run" command is activated, the input is first saved to make sure 
            that the input actually run is that in the interface (contributed by 
            Mesut Karacoç). 

24/07/2007: change "g_strcasecmp" to "g_ascii_strcasecmp" in namelist.c because 
            g_strcasecmp is deprecated and in with some locales it does not work
            properly (eg, Turkish locale!)
