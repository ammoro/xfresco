				- XFresco Notes -
				  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	This is Xfresco, a graphics interface for the coupled channel computer code FRESCO, 
written by Ian Thomson (I.Thompson@surrey.ac.uk). The official site for FRESCO is www.fresco.org.uk

	Note for fresco users:
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	If you are familiarized with the use of fresco you will notice that Xfresco
keeps most of the scheme that fresco uses. In fact, Xfresco has been written trying
to keep compatibility with fresco input files as much as possible. 

	Features not implemented:
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Due mainly to time limitation, some features of fresco are not yet 
implemented in Xfresco. This does not means *neccessary* that input files including these  
features will not be read by Xfresco, but they will be omitted.
 
	Indeed, you can always modify by hand the output code written by 
Xfresco including those things that you have not been able to to include with Xfresco.

	Presently these features are:
	- 2 particle form-factors.
	- core excitation


	Future development:
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Although most of the features of fresco can be understood and parsed by
Xfresco there are still many things to do, and to improve!. Future improvements
depends mainly on time!! Suggestions are welcome. 
		
	   
	
	Reporting Bugs:
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Xfresco is on a very early stage of develpment. Although it has been tested
for many input files it is hard to test for all the possibilities that fresco offers. 
For this reason, Xfresco may contain significant bugs that I hope to fix in
future versions. For this task I would appreciate very much your help. If you find
I bug, please, report it to moro@us.es. Try to provide as much information
as possible: input file that produced the problem, action that caused the program
to crash and whatever you think useful to determine the bug. 

				
							Enjoy it!!!!!!
